# DCM Glitches calculator

Program to calculate the glitches from a Double Crystal Monochromator given a crystal orientation and show them as "spaghetti"-type plots and glitch patterns (showing most common absoption edges positions).

Si111 and Si220 crystals are implemented but more can be added easily.

The calculations are based on the following publication:

[DETERMINATION OF GLITCHES IN SOFT X-RAY MONOCHROMATOR CRYSTALS by G. Van der Laan and B.T. Thole, *Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research*, A263 (1988) 515-521](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0168900288909953)

### Dependencies

DCM Glitches calculator is completely programmed with JavaTM (www.java.com) using OpenJDK version 11.0.9.1 (GNU General Public License, version 2, with the Classpath Exception: https://openjdk.java.net/legal/gplv2+ce.html). You may find Oracle's free, GPL-licensed, production-ready OpenJDK binaries necessary to run it at https://openjdk.java.net/.

The program uses the [com.vava33.BasicPlotPanel](https://github.com/ovallcorba/BasicPlotPanel) plotting library from the same author. It also uses the [vavaUtils libraries](https://github.com/ovallcorba/vavaUtils) com.vava33.cellsymm and com.vava33.jutils
